Q1 How many NIC (network card) does your server have? Show brief output.

A1
[lisa@nepal ~]$ ip -br link show
lo               UNKNOWN        00:00:00:00:00:00 <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP>
enp0s8           UP             08:00:27:64:6f:ef <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP>

It is one NIC(enp0s8).
Note: The lo (loopback device) is added to the server even the server does not have any NICs. It is purely used as diagnostic tool. 

Q2 What IP address and subnet mask does the server NIC have?

A2
[lisa@nepal ~]$ ip -br a s enp0s8
enp0s8           UP             192.168.1.12/24 240d:1a:88d:6400:a00:27ff:fe64:6fef/64 fe80::a00:27ff:fe64:6fef/64

IP address is 192.168.1.12 and subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.
Note: /24 notation is called CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing). 


Q3 How do you check the routing table in the server?

A3
The routing table can be checked by using "ip route show" command.

[lisa@nepal ~]$ ip route show
default via 192.168.1.1 dev enp0s8 proto dhcp src 192.168.1.12 metric 100
192.168.1.0/24 dev enp0s8 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.12 metric 100



Shutdown the server with below command. 
shutdown -h 0 now
Add an additional NIC with same parameter as the existing NIC. Then poweron the server.

*** Make sure to start the script to capture your task ***
Q4 How many NIC (network card) does your server have? Show brief output.

A4
There are two NICs.
[root@nepal ~]# ip -br link show
lo               UNKNOWN        00:00:00:00:00:00 <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP>
enp0s8           UP             08:00:27:64:6f:ef <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP>
enp0s9           UP             08:00:27:f7:64:78 <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP>

Note: Checking at HW level
[root@nepal ~]#  sudo lspci |grep -i Ethernet
00:08.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82540EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 02)
00:09.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82540EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 02)

Q5 Does the new NIC have IP address and subnet mask? If yes, remove it with below command.
sudo ip add del IP-ADDR/CIDR dev NIC  # replace IP-ADDR/CIDR and NIC as appropirate.

A5
Yes, the new NIC enp0s9 have a ip address and subnet mask.
[root@nepal ~]# ip -br a s enp0s9
enp0s9           UP             192.168.1.4/24 240d:1a:88d:6400:13fd:36b6:737:57f3/64 fe80::8253:9ab9:8121:b5ea/64

[root@nepal ~]# ip addr del 192.168.1.4/24 dev enp0s9
[root@nepal ~]# ip -br a s enp0s9
enp0s9           UP             240d:1a:88d:6400:13fd:36b6:737:57f3/64 fe80::8253:9ab9:8121:b5ea/64

[root@nepal ~]# ip addr del 192.168.1.4/24 dev enp0s9
[root@nepal ~]# ip addr del 240d:1a:88d:6400:13fd:36b6:737:57f3/64  dev enp0s9
[root@nepal ~]# ip -br a s enp0s9
enp0s9           UP             fe80::8253:9ab9:8121:b5ea/64



Q6 Make sure no IP address on new NIC. Assign a new IP address on the NIC. 

A6
No more IPv4 IP on enp0s9
[root@nepal ~]# ip -br a s enp0s9
enp0s9           UP             fe80::e12:504c:23da:4e19/64

Note: 192.168.1.100 is not reachable so we can confirm it is free IP.

[root@nepal ~]# ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev enp0s9 metric 110

Note: I had to add metric otherwise network got disconnected.

Q7 How do you test network connectivity to a remote host?

A7
The ping command can be used to test network connectivity to a remote host. 

[root@nepal ~]# ping -c 2 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=58 time=3.32 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=58 time=3.33 ms

--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 1002ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 3.324/3.326/3.328/0.002 ms


Note: Notice the packet loss and time are values normally check during toubleshooting the bad or slow network response. 

Q8 Check the DNS resolution in the server.

A8
[root@nepal ~]# dig +short google.com
142.251.222.14



Q9 What is the name of the server? 

A9
The name of the server is "nepal"
[root@nepal ~]# hostnamectl hostname
nepal

hostname

A10
It is installed Rocky Linux 9.5.

[root@nepal ~]# cat /etc/rocky-release
