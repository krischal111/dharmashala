2. Find filesystem on SCSI disk (e.g. sdb, sdc, sdd) which is not mounted.

3. Create filesystem on the new disks. Make sure 2 ext4 and 1 xfs.

4. Find filesystem on SCSI disk (e.g. sdb, sdc, sdd) which is not mounted.

Break a new disk which has ext4 filesystem with below command and fix it. Replace sdX as appropirate.
