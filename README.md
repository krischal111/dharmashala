## Introduction

This project started with the mindset of retyping and compiling the lab sheets, and clearing up the convoluted course structure of Electronics Engineering. Now, we have strong emphasis on adding many important information and resources related to both Electronics and Computer Engineering.

We have adopted the model of iterative refinement by the community to keep the resource materials up to date, and error free. Every viewers and users of this resources can benefit from the high quality materials that are iteratively refined by the community. You can fork this repo and make a pull request in order to make contribution to this repo.

## Getting Started

In order to view this repository, you can just browse this markdown document, following the hyperlinks that guide you to the resource you want.

## Contributing

## FAQs
Some of the frequently asked questions are:

1. Will this stay relavant after the new course is implemented in IOE?
    - We are compiling the resources, and the core resources do not change.
    - By iterative refinement model, our repo will adapt to the change in the course structure.
    - The change in course takes time to take effect. The things here as it is will stay relavant for 3 more years to come. After that small tweaks will make them just as relavant to new course students.

2. **Why** should I contribute to this repository?
    - This a collection of all the resources that you need as a Electronics or Computer Engineering student in IOE, all together. Since, this repository is not complete, contributing helps to speed up the completion. Remember, every contribute matters.

3. Why **should** I contribute to this repository?
    - A resource repository of this nature is not so common. We are hosting this repository so that everyone gets easy access to this, and for free. To make that dream possible, you should contribute to this repository.

4. Why should **I** contribute to this repository?
    - It will help you gain more clarity on the subject matter. Also, contributing to an open source is one of the best way to make your portfolio better.
